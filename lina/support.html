    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What is Lina AI?</div>
        <p>Lina AI is an innovative mobile application that uses artificial intelligence to generate high-quality images based on your text prompts. Whether you're seeking creative inspiration, designing visual content, or just having fun with AI, Lina AI provides an intuitive interface to bring your ideas to life through state-of-the-art image generation.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How do I generate images with Lina AI?</div>
        <p>Simply type a text prompt describing what you'd like to see, select your preferred aspect ratio (1:1, 3:2, or 2:3), and tap the generate button. Lina AI will process your request and create an image based on your description. For best results, be specific and detailed in your prompts.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What are credits and how do they work?</div>
        <p>Credits are the in-app currency used for generating images. Each image generation costs a specific number of credits (typically 3 credits per image). You can purchase credit packages through in-app purchases. New users receive 10 free credits upon registration to get started.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How can I purchase more credits?</div>
        <p>You can purchase additional credits directly within the app. Navigate to the credits or store section, select your preferred credit package, and follow the on-screen instructions to complete your purchase through your App Store account.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Are my purchases restored if I reinstall the app or get a new device?</div>
        <p>Yes. Since credits are tied to your Lina AI account, they will be available when you log in on any device. If you've made purchases and they don't appear, you can use the "Restore Purchases" option in the app settings to restore any previously purchased credits.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How can I save or share the images I generate?</div>
        <p>After an image is generated, you can download it to your device's gallery by tapping the download button. From there, you can share it through any app on your device. You can also share directly from the app using the share button.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Can I edit or enhance images after they're generated?</div>
        <p>Currently, Lina AI focuses on image generation rather than editing. However, you can use the generated images as a starting point and regenerate with more specific prompts to achieve your desired result. You can also use external editing apps for further modifications.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What happens if I'm not satisfied with the generated image?</div>
        <p>AI image generation is a creative process that may require refinement. If you're not satisfied with the result, try rephrasing your prompt to be more specific about what you want. You can also check our blog for tips on writing effective prompts for better results.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Is there a limit to how many images I can generate?</div>
        <p>The only limit is your available credits. As long as you have credits in your account, you can continue generating images. We do not impose daily or monthly generation limits.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Who owns the images created with Lina AI?</div>
        <p>You own the rights to the specific outputs generated by the app based on your inputs, subject to our underlying intellectual property rights in the technology and models as outlined in our End-User License Agreement.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How do I reset my password?</div>
        <p>If you've forgotten your password, tap on the "Forgot Password" link on the login screen. Enter your email address, and we'll send you a verification code. Use this code to set a new password.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How can I delete my account?</div>
        <p>To delete your account, please contact our support team at i.hou@163.com with your request. Please note that account deletion is permanent and will result in the loss of any remaining credits and your generation history.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">The app is crashing or not responding</div>
        <p>Try these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Force close the app and restart it</li>
            <li>Ensure your device has sufficient storage space</li>
            <li>Check that you're using the latest version of the app</li>
            <li>Restart your device</li>
            <li>Uninstall and reinstall the app (your account and purchases will be preserved)</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Image generation is taking too long</div>
        <p>Image generation typically takes 10-30 seconds depending on the complexity of your prompt and current server load. If it's taking significantly longer:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Check your internet connection</li>
            <li>Cancel the current generation and try again</li>
            <li>Try a simpler prompt</li>
            <li>If the issue persists, it may indicate a temporary server issue</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">My purchase was successful but I didn't receive my credits</div>
        <p>If you completed a purchase but didn't receive your credits:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Wait a few minutes as sometimes there's a delay in processing</li>
            <li>Restart the app</li>
            <li>Go to Settings and tap "Restore Purchases"</li>
            <li>If you still don't see your credits, contact our support team with your purchase receipt</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
